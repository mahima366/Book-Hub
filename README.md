# Book-Hub

Book Hub have long been vital sources of knowledge and resources, playing an essential role in supporting education, research, and cultural enrichment. However, traditional book hub processes, often reliant on manual record-keeping, pose challenges in efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility. Our Book Hub is a solution that leverages technology to address these issues, automating essential library operations and simplifying tasks for both librarians and patrons. This project aims to design and implement an book hub using Java, providing a modernized approach that enhances resource accessibility and streamlines daily operations.

The Library Management System is built on a three-tier architecture: frontend, backend, and database. The frontend, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides a user-friendly interface where library staff and patrons can access various features easily. The backend,designed using Java (JDK 8+), and JDBC, is responsible for processing transactions such as lending, returns, and managing user sessions. This structure ensures that the system can efficiently handle multiple users simultaneously while maintaining data integrity and security.

MySQL is used as the database, offering a structured environment to store information on books, members, transactions, and overdue notices. By enabling efficient data retrieval, the Book Hub allows users to search for books by title, author, or genre, check availability, and reserve items online. One notable feature is the automated notification system, which alerts members about due dates and overdue books, promoting timely returns and reducing manual follow-ups by library staff.

The report elaborates on each phase of the Book Hub development, from requirements gathering to implementation and testing, detailing the design choices, challenges, and solutions that shaped the final product. Additionally, it discusses the benefits of this system in enhancing operations, offering streamlined management, improved access to resources, and an overall better experience for users. This Book Hub ultimately represents a step forward in the digital transformation of libraries, ensuring their continued relevance and efficiency in an increasingly digital world.
